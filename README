Dec. 31, 2021. Version 1.32

1. Improved function el2.test.wtm() by eliminating two
for-loops. It is now faster.
For larger samples, more improvement in computing time.

For example: for sample sizes (72, 41), [the aSAH data set]
the computing time is better than 1/5 of the old version.
(5.5 times faster).

2. Also in the el2.test.wtm(), change b%*%solve(A) to solve(A, b)

3. Modified el2.test.tws(). We added a new input: lamOld.
This can be used to improve computation of root (lambda)
in iterations.
You do not have to always start from 0 to search for root,
you may start from the previous solution.
Although the default is lamOld=0.

4. Some minor modification on the determination of interval
  [lo, up] for the uniroot() to find root (lam).
